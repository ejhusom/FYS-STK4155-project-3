	title = {Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks},
	abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We ﬁrst observe the inﬂuence of the non-linear activations functions. We ﬁnd that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We ﬁnd that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneﬁcial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difﬁcult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

@article{bao,
abstract = {In this work, algorithms are developed and evaluated to detect physical activities from data acquired using five small biaxial accelerometers worn simultaneously on different parts of the body. Acceleration data was collected from 20 subjects without researcher supervision or observation. Subjects were asked to perform a sequence of everyday tasks but not told specifically where or how to do them. Mean, energy, frequency-domain entropy, and correlation of acceleration data was calculated and several classifiers using these features were tested. Decision tree classifiers showed the best performance recognizing everyday activities with an overall accuracy rate of 84{\%}. The results show that although some activities are recognized well with subject-independent training data, others appear to require subject-specific training data. The results suggest that multiple accelerometers aid in recognition because conjunctions in acceleration feature values can effectively discriminate many activities. With just two biaxial accelerometers - thigh and wrist - the recognition performance dropped only slightly. This is the first work to investigate performance of recognition algorithms with multiple, wire-free accelerometers on 20 activities using datasets annotated by the subjects themselves. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

@article{Lustrek2009,
abstract = {Due to the rapid aging of the European population, an effort needs to be made to ensure that the elderly can live longer independently with minimal support of the working-age population. The Confidence project aims to do this by unobtrusively monitoring their activity to recognize falls and other health problems. This is achieved by equipping the user with radio tags, from which the locations of body parts are determined, thus enabling posture and movement reconstruction. In the paper we first give a general overview of the research on fall detection and activity recognition. We proceed to describe the machine learning approach to activity recognition to be used in the Confidence project. In this approach, the attributes characterizing the user's behavior and a machine learning algorithm must be selected. The attributes we consider are the locations of body parts in the reference coordinate system (fixed with respect to the environment), the locations of body parts in a body coordinate system (affixed to the user's body) and the angles between adjacent body parts. Eight machine learning algorithms are compared. The highest classification accuracy of over 95 {\%} is achieved by Support Vector Machine used on the reference attributes and angles.},

@article{Jordao2018,
abstract = {Human activity recognition based on wearable sensor data has been an attractive research topic due to its application in areas such as healthcare and smart environments. In this context, many works have presented remarkable results using accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer data to represent the activities categories. However, current studies do not consider important issues that lead to skewed results, making it hard to assess the quality of sensor-based human activity recognition and preventing a direct comparison of previous works. These issues include the samples generation processes and the validation protocols used. We emphasize that in other research areas, such as image classification and object detection, these issues are already well-defined, which brings more efforts towards the application. Inspired by this, we conduct an extensive set of experiments that analyze different sample generation processes and validation protocols to indicate the vulnerable points in human activity recognition based on wearable sensor data. For this purpose, we implement and evaluate several top-performance methods, ranging from handcrafted-based approaches to convolutional neural networks. According to our study, most of the experimental evaluations that are currently employed are not adequate to perform the activity recognition in the context of wearable sensor data, in which the recognition accuracy drops considerably when compared to an appropriate evaluation approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that tackles essential issues that compromise the understanding of the performance in human activity recognition based on wearable sensor data.},
